*Model data as beliefs (at a certain time) about events (at a certain time).*

The `timely-beliefs` package provides a convenient data model for numerical time series,
that is both simple enough for humans to understand and sufficiently rich for forecasting and machine learning.
The data model is an extended [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame that assigns properties and index levels to describe:

- [What the data is about](#events-and-sensors)
- Who (or what) created the data
- [When the data was created](#beliefs-in-physics)
- How certain they were

The package contains the following functionality:

- [A model for time series data](#the-data-model) suitable for a notebook or a database mixin
- [Selecting/querying beliefs](#convenient-slicing-methods), e.g. those held at a certain moment in time
- [Computing accuracy](#accuracy), e.g. that of probabilistic forecasts
- [Resampling time series with uncertainty](#resampling) (experimental)
- [Visualising time series and accuracy metrics](#visualisation) (experimental)

Some use cases of the package:

- Clearly distinguish forecasts from rolling forecasts.
- Analyse your predictive power by showing forecast accuracy as you approach an event.
- Learn **when** someone is a bad predictor.
- Evaluate the risk of being wrong about an event.

Check out [our interactive demonstration](http://forecasting-accuracy.seita.nl) comparing forecasting models for renewable energy production.
These visuals are created simply by calling the plot method on our BeliefsDataFrame, using the visualisation library [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/).

The first 8 entries of this BeliefsDataFrame show beliefs about a single event.
Beliefs were formed by two distinct sources (1 and 2), with the first updating its beliefs at a later time.
Source A first thought the value of this event would be 100 Â± 10 (the probabilities suggest a normal distribution),
and then increased its accuracy by lowering the standard deviation to 1.
Source B thought the value would be equally likely to be 0 or 100.

### Keeping track of time

#### Events and sensors

Numerical data quantifies something, it is a value assigned to an event;
a physical event, such as a temperature reading, power flow or water flow,
or an economical event, such as daily goods sold or a price agreement about a future delivery.
An event typically takes some time, so it has an `event_start` and an `event_end` time.

To observe an event, we need a sensor. We say that a sensor has a certain `event_resolution`:

    event_resolution = event_end - event_start

We define the resolution to be a fixed property of the sensor. For example:

- An anemometer (wind speed meter) determines the number of revolutions within some period of time.
- A futures contract determines the price of a future delivery within some period of time.

#### Beliefs in physics

Assigning a value to an event implies a belief.
We say that a belief can be formed some time before or after an event, and call this time `belief_time`.
A weather forecast is a good example, where:

    belief_time < event_end

For physical events, the time at which we can say the event could be known (which we call `knowledge_time`) is at the `event_end`.

    knowledge_time = event_end

The forecast horizon, or `belief_horizon`, says how long before (the event could be known) the belief was formed: 

    belief_horizon = knowledge_time - belief_time

For example, a forecast of solar irradiation on June 10th 2017 with a horizon of 27 hours means a belief time of 9 PM on June 9th 2017.
That is:

    event_start = datetime(2017, 6, 10, hour=0)
    event_end = datetime(2017, 6, 11, hour=0)
    belief_horizon = timedelta(hours=27)
    belief_time = datetime(2017, 6, 9, hour=21)

#### Beliefs in economics

For economical events, the time at which we say an event could be known is typically not at the `event_end`.
Most contracts deal with future events, such that:

    knowledge_time < event_start

The `knowledge_horizon` says how long before (the event starts) the event could be known:

    knowledge_horizon > 0  # for most economical events
    knowledge_horizon = -resolution  # for physical events

We define the knowledge horizon to be a fixed property of the sensor.
For example, hourly prices on the day-ahead electricity market are determined at noon one day before delivery starts, such that:

    knowledge_time = event_start.replace(hour=12) - timedelta(days=1)

Then for an hourly price between 3 and 4 PM on June 10th 2017:
    
    event_start = datetime(2017, 6, 10, hour=15)
    event_end = datetime(2017, 6, 10, hour=16)
    knowledge_time = datetime(2017, 6, 9, hour=12)
    knowledge_horizon = timedelta(hours=27)

Continuing this example, a price forecast with a forecast horizon of 1 hour constitutes a belief formed at 11 AM:

    belief_horizon = timedelta(hours=1)
    belief_time = datetime(2017, 6, 9, hour=11)

In general, we have the following relationships:

    belief_time + belief_horizon = knowledge_time
    belief_time + belief_horizon + knowledge_horizon = event_start 
    belief_time + belief_horizon + knowledge_horizon + event_resolution = event_end

#### A common misconception

In many applications, people tend to interpret a forecast horizon as the duration between forming the belief and the start of the event.
When this happens, we have:

    forecast_horizon = event_start - belief_time

and:

    forecast_horizon = belief_horizon + knowledge_horizon

For example, consider a forecast formed at 9 AM about the average wind speed between 10 and 11 AM.
It may feel intuitive to talk about a forecast horizon of 1 hour, because people tend to index events by their start time and then talk about the timing of beliefs with respect to that index.

While this is a perfectly acceptable definition, we set out to be precise in handling the timing of beliefs.
Therefore, we use the term `belief_horizon` rather than `forecast_horizon` throughout the `timely-beliefs` package.

#### Special cases

##### Instantaneous events
Instantaneous events can be modelled by defining a sensor with:

    event_resolution = 0

##### Past events

Beliefs about past events can be modelled using a negative horizon:

    belief_horizon < 0
    knowledge_time < belief_time

That is, your beliefs can still change after you (think you) know about an event.
NB in the following case a price has been determined (you could know about it) for a future event:

    knowledge_time < belief_time < event_start 

##### Ex-post knowledge

Our concept of `knowledge_time` supports to define sensors for agreements about ongoing or past events, such as ex-post contracts.

    event_start < knowledge_time
    -resolution < knowledge_horizon < 0  # for ongoing events
    knowledge_horizon < -resolution  # for past events

### Convenient slicing methods

#### Rolling viewpoint

Select the latest forecasts from a rolling viewpoint (beliefs formed at least 2 days and 10 hours before the event could be known):

    >>> df = timely_beliefs.examples.example_df
    >>> df.rolling_viewpoint(timedelta(days=2, hours=10))

Notice the time-aggregation of probabilistic beliefs about the two events between 10 AM and noon.
Three possible outcomes for both events led to nine possible worlds, because downsampling assumes by default that the values indicate discrete possible outcomes.

### Lineage

Get the (number of) sources contributing to the BeliefsDataFrame:

    >>> df.lineage.sources
    array([1, 2], dtype=int64)
    >>> df.lineage.number_of_sources
    2

## Accuracy

The accuracy of a belief is defined with respect to some reference.
The default reference is the most recent belief held by the same source,
but it is possible to set beliefs held by a specific source at a specific time to serve as the reference instead.

### Accuracy and error metrics

To our knowledge, there is no standard metric for accuracy.
However, there are some standard metrics for what can be considered to be its opposite: error. 
By default, we give back the Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
and the Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE).
Each of these metrics is a representation of how wrong a belief is (believed to be),
with its convenience depending on use case.
For example, for intermittent demand time series (i.e. sparse data with lots of zero values) MAPE is not a useful metric.
For an intuitive representation of accuracy that works in many cases, we suggest to use `df["accuracy"] = 1 - df["wape"]`.
With this definition:

- 100% accuracy denotes that all values are correct
- 50% accuracy denotes that, on average, the values are wrong by half of the reference value
- 0% accuracy denotes that, on average, the values are wrong by exactly the reference value (i.e. zeros or twice the reference value)
- negative accuracy denotes that, on average, the values are off-the-chart wrong (by more than the reference value itself)

### Probabilistic forecasts

The previous metrics (MAE, MAPE and WAPE) are technically not defined for probabilistic beliefs.
However, there is a straightforward generalisation of MAE called the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), which is used instead.
The other metrics follow by dividing over the deterministic reference value.
For simplicity in usage of the `timely-beliefs` package,
the metrics names in the BeliefsDataFrame are the same regardless of whether the beliefs are deterministic or probabilistic.  

### Probabilistic reference

It is possible that the reference itself is a probabilistic belief rather than a deterministic belief.
Our implementation of CRPS handles this case, too, by calculating the distance between the cumulative distribution functions of each forecast and reference [(Hans Hersbach, 2000)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0434%282000%29015%3C0559%3ADOTCRP%3E2.0.CO%3B2).
As the denominator for calculating MAPE and WAPE, we use the expected value of the probabilistic reference.

### Viewpoints

There are two common use cases for wanting to know the accuracy of beliefs,
each with a different viewpoint.
With a rolling viewpoint, you get the accuracy of beliefs at a certain `belief_horizon` before (or after) `knowledge_time`,
for example, some days before each event ends.

    >>> df.rolling_viewpoint_accuracy(timedelta(days=2, hours=9), reference_source=df.lineage.sources[0])
                     mae      mape      wape
    source                                  
    Source A    1.482075  0.014821  0.005928
    Source B  125.853250  0.503413  0.503413

With a fixed viewpoint, you get the accuracy of beliefs held at a certain `belief_time`. 

    >>> df.fixed_viewpoint_accuracy(datetime(2000, 1, 2, tzinfo=utc), reference_source=df.lineage.sources[0])
                    mae      mape      wape
    source                                 
    Source A    0.00000  0.000000  0.000000
    Source B  125.85325  0.503413  0.503413
